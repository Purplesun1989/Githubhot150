# 🚀 LeetCode Top Interview 150 - Python Excellence

This repository contains my optimized solutions for the **LeetCode Top Interview 150**. As a Computer Science student, my objective is to provide implementations that are not only clean and "Pythonic" but also achieve **100% Runtime Beats** on the LeetCode platform.

## 🎯 Engineering Principles

* **Algorithm Efficiency**: Every solution is implemented with the theoretical optimal Time Complexity ($O(N)$, $O(\log N)$, etc.).
* **100% Beats Strategy**: Leveraging Python's internal optimizations, such as using `list.pop()`, `collections.deque`, and minimizing attribute lookups.
* **Readability**: Maintaining PEP 8 standards while pushing for performance.

## 📊 Roadmap & Progress

| Category | Status | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Array / String** | 🟢 In Progress | In-place manipulation & Sliding Windows |
| **Two Pointers** | 🟢 In Progress | Optimal boundary convergence |
| **Hash-stack** | ⚪ Pending | $O(1)$ Lookups & Monotonic Stacks |
| **Tree / Graph** | ⚪ Pending | DFS/BFS & Recursive Optimization |
| **Dynamic Programming** | ⚪ Pending | State Compression & Memoization |

## ⚡ Performance Optimization Checklist

To ensure a **100% Runtime Beat** in Python, I apply the following techniques:
1.  **Fast I/O**: Disabling synchronization with standard streams where applicable.
2.  **Local Variables**: Accessing local variables is faster than global or attribute lookups in Python's VM.
3.  **Built-in Mastery**: Using C-implemented functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `zip()` for heavy lifting.
